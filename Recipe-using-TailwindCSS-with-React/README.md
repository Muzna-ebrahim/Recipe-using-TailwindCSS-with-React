# Chicken Sandwich Recipe App

I built this simple recipe app while learning TailwindCSS with React. It's part of my Moringa School GenAI Capstone Project where I wanted to explore how AI can help you pick up new technologies quickly.

## What This Project Does

This app displays a chicken sandwich recipe with a clean, simple interface. I focused on using TailwindCSS utility classes to handle all the styling - from the olive green background to the black underlined heading and ingredient list.

I kept everything straightforward on purpose. Sometimes when you're learning something new, simple examples work better than complex ones.

## What I Used

- React with Vite for the frontend
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Just plain JavaScript, nothing fancy

## How to Run This Locally

If you want to check this out on your machine:

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muzna-ebrahim/Recipe-using-TailwindCSS-with-React.git
cd Recipe-using-TailwindCSS-with-React
```

2. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and go to the URL shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)

## What I Learned

Working on this project taught me how TailwindCSS makes styling so much faster. Instead of writing separate CSS files, you just add classes directly to your HTML elements. The utility-first approach felt weird at first, but it grows on you.

I also got to see how AI can be a great learning companion. Instead of spending hours reading documentation, I could ask questions and get immediate feedback on my code.

### Prompt-Powered Kickstart: Building a Beginner's Toolkit for TailwindCSS

**Student Name:** Muzna Ebrahim  
**Program:** Moringa School  
**Project Type:** GenAI Capstone – Beginner's Toolkit with GenAI

#### Overview

This documentation describes how I used Generative AI prompts to learn TailwindCSS and apply it in a simple React project. The aim was to create a beginner-friendly toolkit that helps anyone get started with TailwindCSS by following clear steps and examples.

The project focuses on building a simple recipe card user interface styled using TailwindCSS utility classes, including layout styling, background colors, text styling, and interactive elements.

#### Project Goals

The goals of this project were to:
- Learn TailwindCSS as a new frontend styling framework
- Use AI prompts to guide learning and problem-solving
- Build a simple runnable React UI (recipe card)
- Document the setup process so beginners can replicate it
- Reflect on how AI improved my learning experience

#### Why TailwindCSS?

I chose TailwindCSS because it uses a utility-first approach that allows styling directly in JSX without writing separate CSS files. This makes it faster to prototype and easier for beginners to understand how styling works.

#### System Requirements

- Operating System: Linux / Windows / macOS
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Git and GitHub

#### AI Prompt Journey

**Prompt 1: Understanding TailwindCSS**  
*"Explain TailwindCSS in simple terms for a beginner using React."*

This prompt helped me understand the utility-first concept and how TailwindCSS differs from traditional CSS.

**Prompt 2: Installing TailwindCSS**  
*"Give me a step-by-step guide to install TailwindCSS in a React project using Vite."*

The AI response guided me through installing and configuring TailwindCSS correctly.

**Prompt 3: Centering Content**  
*"How do I put the card at the centre and give it a light green background using TailwindCSS?"*

I learned how to use flex, items-center, and justify-center to center content and choose gradients.

#### Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue 1: npm install error**  
*Cause:* package.json file was missing  
*Fix:* Initialized the React project using Vite before installing dependencies

**Issue 2: TailwindCSS styles not applying**  
*Cause:* Incorrect content paths or missing Tailwind directives  
*Fix:* Verified tailwind.config.js paths and added Tailwind directives to index.css

#### Reflection

Using Generative AI made it easier to learn TailwindCSS step by step. The prompts helped me understand layout utilities, text styling, and component design. This project improved my confidence in learning new frontend technologies using AI as a learning assistant.
