# Chicken Sandwich Recipe App

I built this simple recipe app while learning TailwindCSS with React. It's part of my Moringa School GenAI Capstone Project where I wanted to explore how AI can help you pick up new technologies quickly.

## What This Project Does

This app displays a chicken sandwich recipe with a clean, simple interface. I focused on using TailwindCSS utility classes to handle all the styling - from the olive green background to the black underlined heading and ingredient list.

I kept everything straightforward on purpose. Sometimes when you're learning something new, simple examples work better than complex ones.

## What I Used

- React with Vite for the frontend
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Just plain JavaScript, nothing fancy

## How to Run This Locally

If you want to check this out on your machine:

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muzna-ebrahim/Recipe-using-TailwindCSS-with-React.git
cd Recipe-using-TailwindCSS-with-React
```

2. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and go to the URL shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)

## What I Learned

Working on this project taught me how TailwindCSS makes styling so much faster. Instead of writing separate CSS files, you just add classes directly to your HTML elements. The utility-first approach felt weird at first, but it grows on you.

I also got to see how AI can be a great learning companion. Instead of spending hours reading documentation, I could ask questions and get immediate feedback on my code.
